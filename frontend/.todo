AUTH
[backend]

- over logic? over validation? over time/space/effort taking?
- verifyToken controller safe? compare middleware
  [frontend]
- propper authentication & authorization flow?
- proper login, register, logout, token refresh logic, refreshing tab [refresh vs navigate flow]
- proper error handling? should print on console? better approach?

DB

- race conditions, thread, async, sync
- optimized query handling

sameSite: "strict" vs "Lax"
csrf - Protect state-changing routes
window.location, navigation

need of class over Function & where to use

accessToekn get removed when

- expires
- logout
- error
  refreshToken refreshed when
- 401 error with token expires

need to get new token when accessToekn expires | not found & refreshToken still valid
